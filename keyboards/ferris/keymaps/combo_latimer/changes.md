# Changelog

## 2024-04-18

### Added
- Added control mod-tap to the space bar.
    - Just lets me use control more easily and in reality I am never holding KC_SPACE

### Removed
- Turned off autoshift for now. Dislike it.

### Changed
- Moved <> to beneath []
- Combo for backspace and delete now looks more like artseyio. This also avoids me hitting them accidentally.
- Removed the ctrl a combo as having control on the thumb works nicely. (Also using wezterm at home now.)

### Ideas
- I don't rate autoshift in the long run but I do like it on certain keys
    - ;/:
- Maybe trying a shift tap on thumb button that is used for shift. However, sometimes I might want to tap shift? e.g. capsword (which I like)
- Maybe add _ to the capsword allowed symbols, but maybe just get good and use -.


## Lots of other releases
